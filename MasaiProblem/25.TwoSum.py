# Two Numbers in sorted array whose sum is K
# Given a sorted array of integers nums and an integer K, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to K.

# Note: You can assume that the answer always exists

# Sample Input
# array = [2,7,11,15], K = 9
# Sample Output
# [0,1]
# Sample Explanation
# As seen from the sample input, the values at index 0 and 1 add up to the required value of 9. Therefore, the output is [0,1].

# Expected Time Complexity
# O(N),where N is the size of the array.

# Expected Space Complexity
# O(1), Auxillary space complexity.

# Constraints
#  2 <= nums.length <= 103
# -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
# -10^9 <= target <= 10^9


#Tc=O(n)
#Sc=O(1)
